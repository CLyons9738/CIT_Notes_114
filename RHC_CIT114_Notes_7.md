# Storage in AWS

### Volatile vs Non-Volatile Storage
* An example of Volatile storage is RAM. Doesn't save any data on its own.
* Non-Volatile storage is kept on ssd or hardrive
### Key Concepts
* **Fault Tolerance** is the idea that everything keeps on running once it goes down.
* **Replication** makes it so that just incase the main system goes down theres a backup duplicate ready to go.
* **Raid** backs up your data every so often

### Backing Up Data
* Copying data from one to another
* Critical Data decides what absolutely needs to be backed up. Such as Bank data or Medical data.
* Daily backups keeps data constanly saved.
* Offsite allows you to have data in a secure location.

### Amazon S3 uses
* Backs up all your data and restores so you dont have to worry about losing anything.
* S3 has smart pricing so you wont have to waste money on excess storage.

### Elasticity of Amazon
* If you need more storage it can go up easily
* With block storage you're allowed to change a specific block instead of having to edit the whole thing.
* EFS uses shared storage.
