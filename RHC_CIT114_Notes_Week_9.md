# Storage in AWS

### Volatile vs Non-Volatile Storage
* An example of Volatile storage is RAM. Doesn't save any data on its own.
### Key Concepts
* Fault Tolerance is the idea that everything keeps on running once it goes down.
* Replication makes it so that just incase the main system goes down theres a backup duplicate ready to go.
